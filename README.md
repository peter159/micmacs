# MICMACS

MicMacs is trying to make a mimic of spacemacs, but simpler for management, you can copy from the following hub using git the following way, enjoy it!!
```bash
git clone git@github.com:peter159/mimacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```

For server user, since emacs is running a deamon for server, make a short cut applying something like the below to use it(change the path to your path). Look at [wiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsMsWindowsIntegration) to see the explanation of how emacsclient works
```bash
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\emacsclientw.exe -cna C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\runemacs.exe
<!-- make a shortcut in windows using this path -->
```
Fonts, is sometimes critical for UI thing, here recommend to use `Fira Code Retina` for English and `等距更纱黑体 SC` for Chinese, can download them from here
```bash
[Fira Code Retina-%S](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/download/1.206/FiraCode_1.206.zip)
