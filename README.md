# MIMACS

### MIMCAS is actually a mimic of spacemacs, but simpler for management, you can copy the following hub using git the following way, enjoy it!!
```
git clone git@github.com:peter159/mimacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```

### For server user, since emacs is running a deamon for server, make a short cut as below to use it(change the path to your path).Look at wiki[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsMsWindowsIntegration] to see the explanation of how it works
```
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\emacsclientw.exe -cna C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\runemacs.exe
```
